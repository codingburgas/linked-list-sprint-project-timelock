The early modern period is a historical period that is defined either as part of or as immediately preceding the modern period, with 
divisions based primarily on the history of Europe and the broader concept of modernity. There is no exact date that marks the beginning
or end of the period and its extent may vary depending on the area of history being studied. In general, the early modern period is 
considered to have lasted from around the start of the 16th century to the start of the 19th century.
