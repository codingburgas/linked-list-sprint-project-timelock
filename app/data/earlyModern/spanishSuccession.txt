Treaty of Utrecht ends War of Spanish Succession, (April 1713 - September 1714), a series of treaties between France and other
European powers (April 11, 1713 to Sept. 7, 1714) and another series between Spain and other powers (July 13, 1713 to June 
26, 1714), concluding the War of the Spanish Succession (1701 - 1714). The war involved three contenders for the vacant throne 
of Spain, and involved much of Europe for over a decade. Essentially, the treaties allowed Philip V (grandson of 
King Louis XIV of France) to keep the Spanish throne in return for permanently renouncing his claim to the French throne, 
along with other necessary guarantees that would ensure that France and Spain should not merge, thus preserving the balance 
of power in Europe.
