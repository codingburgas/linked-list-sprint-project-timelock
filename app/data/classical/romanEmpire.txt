The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire was a complex, centuries-long process that ultimately resulted in the collapse of 
the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. This decline was driven by internal struggles, economic difficulties, military failures,
and increasing pressure from external enemies. Despite the fall of the West, the Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine 
Empire, preserved much of Rome's legacy and remained a dominant power for nearly a millennium. Throughout its decline, Rome 
faced growing challenges, including political corruption, administrative inefficiency, and civil wars that weakened its ability 
to govern effectively. Economic troubles, such as heavy taxation, inflation, and reliance on slave labor, further strained 
the empire's stability. At the same time, the Roman military became increasingly dependent on foreign mercenaries who were 
often unreliable and lacked loyalty to Rome.
