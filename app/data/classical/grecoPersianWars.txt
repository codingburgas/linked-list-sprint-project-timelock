Greco-Persian Wars, (492 - 449 BCE), series of wars fought by Greek states and Persia over a period of almost half a century. 
The fighting was most intense during two invasions that Persia launched against mainland Greece between 490 and 479. Although 
the Persian empire was at the peak of its strength, the collective defense mounted by the Greeks overcame seemingly impossible 
odds and even succeeded in liberating Greek city-states on the fringe of Persia itself. The Greek triumph ensured the survival 
of Greek culture and political structures long after the demise of the Persian empire.
