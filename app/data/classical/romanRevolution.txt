The Roman Revolution (133â€“27 BCE) was a period of intense political and social upheaval that transformed Rome from a Republic 
to an Empire. It saw the erosion of traditional Republican institutions, the rise of powerful military leaders, and the 
centralization of power under a single ruler. The revolution was marked by a series of internal conflicts, shifting 
alliances, and military confrontations that ultimately led to the establishment of the Roman Empire under Augustus.
