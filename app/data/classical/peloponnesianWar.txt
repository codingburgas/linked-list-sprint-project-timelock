Peloponnesian War, (431 - 404 BCE), war fought between the two leading city-states in ancient Greece, Athens and Sparta. Each 
stood at the head of alliances that, between them, included nearly every Greek city-state. This war shifted power from Athens 
to Sparta, making Sparta the most powerful city-state in the region. The war featured two periods of combat separated by a 
six-year truce.
