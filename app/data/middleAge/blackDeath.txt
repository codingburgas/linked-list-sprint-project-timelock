The Black Death was a bubonic plague pandemic that occurred in Europe from 1346 to 1353. It was one of the most fatal pandemics 
in human history; as many as 50 million people perished, perhaps 50% of Europe's 14th century population. One of the most 
significant events in European history, the Black Death had far-reaching population, economic, and cultural impacts. It 
was the beginning of the second plague pandemic. The plague created religious, social and economic upheavals, with profound 
effects on the course of European history.
