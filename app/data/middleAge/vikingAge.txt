The Viking Age (about 800 - 1050 CE) was the period during the Middle Ages when Norseman known as vikings undertook large-scale 
raiding, colonising, conquest, and trading throughout Europe and reached North America. The Viking Age applies not only to 
their homeland of Scandinavia but also to any place significantly settled by Scandinavians during the period. The 
Scandinavians of the Viking Age are often referred to as Vikings as well as Norsemen, although few of them were Vikings in 
the sense of being engaged in piracy.
