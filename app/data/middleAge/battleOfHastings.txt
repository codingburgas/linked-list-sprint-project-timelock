The Battle of Hastings took place on October 14, 1066, in England. It was a decisive conflict between the Norman-French army led 
by William, Duke of Normandy (later known as William the Conqueror) and the Anglo-Saxon English army under King Harold Godwinson.
The battle resulted in a Norman victory, and Harold was killedâ€”legend says by an arrow to the eye. This win allowed William to 
become King of England, marking the beginning of Norman rule and significantly transforming English culture, language, and 
governance.
