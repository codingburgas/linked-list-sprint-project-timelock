Stone Age, prehistoric cultural stage, or level of human development, characterized by the creation and use of stone tools.
The Stone Age, whose origin coincides with the discovery of the oldest known stone tools, which have been dated to some 3.3 
million years ago, is usually divided into three separate periods—Palaeolithic Period, Mesolithic Period, and Neolithic 
Period—based on the degree of sophistication in the fashioning and use of tools. Paleolithic archaeology is concerned with 
the origins and development of early human culture between the first appearance of human beings as tool-using mammals (which 
is believed to have occurred sometime before 3.3 million years ago) and about 8000 BCE.
