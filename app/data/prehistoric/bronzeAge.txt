The Bronze Age was the time from around 2,000BC to 700BC when people used bronze. In the Stone Age, flint was shaped and used 
as tools and weapons, but in the Bronze Age, stone was gradually replaced by bronze. Bronze was made by melting tin and 
copper, and mixing them together. The bronze could then be poured in to moulds to create useful items. Larger groups had their 
own bronze-smith to make their bronze tools, while everyone else had to go to a travelling bronze - smith. The travelling 
bronze - smiths would set up camp near a settlement and try to trade new bronze tools for old ones, food and clothes. Early 
Bronze Age people still moved from place to place, following herds of animals that could be hunted. Later on, as people 
started farming, they began to settle in one place and settlements of permanent huts were constructed.
