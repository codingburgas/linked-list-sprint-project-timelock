Industrial Revolution, in modern history, the process of change from an agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by 
industry and machine manufacturing. These technological changes introduced novel ways of working and living and fundamentally 
transformed society. This process began in Britain in the 18th century and from there spread to other parts of the world. 
Although used earlier by French writers, the term Industrial Revolution was first popularized by the English economic 
historian Arnold Toynbee (1852–83) to describe Britain’s economic development from 1760 to 1840. Since Toynbee’s time the 
term has been more broadly applied as a process of economic transformation than as a period of time in a particular setting.
