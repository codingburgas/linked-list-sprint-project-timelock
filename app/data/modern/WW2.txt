World War II or the Second World War (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) was a global conflict between two coalitions: the
Allies and the Axis powers. Nearly all of the world’s countries participated, with many nations mobilising all resources in 
pursuit of total war. Tanks and aircraft played major roles, enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the 
first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70 to 85 
million deaths.
