The Cold War was a period of global geopolitical rivalry between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) and their respective allies, the capitalist Western Bloc and communist Eastern Bloc, which lasted from 1947 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The term Cold War is used because there was no direct fighting between the two superpowers, though each supported opposing sides in regional conflicts known as proxy wars.
