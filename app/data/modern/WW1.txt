World War I or the First World War (28 July 1914 - 11 November 1918), also known as the Great War, was a global conflict 
between two coalitions: the Allies (or Entente) and the Central Powers. Fighting took place mainly in Europe and the 
Middle East, as well as in parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific, and in Europe was characterised by trench warfare; the 
widespread use of artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons (gas); and the introductions of tanks and aircraft. World 
War I was one of the deadliest conflicts in history.
